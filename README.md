# hello-world
Hi, 

1cherryTree was a name that was available, and I like the blossoming trees in spring.
English is not my native language, please do not count the mistakes.
I am in a health profession and I never imagined that I would get interested in any IT topics. Somehow I found Codecademy, tried to learn Javascript and told everybody that I was learning Java because I did not know the difference. Later I discovered Python and Linux and then I was hooked. 

On GitHub I hope to find projects, to learn how to work together on projects and to start my own projects. 

Thanks for reading
